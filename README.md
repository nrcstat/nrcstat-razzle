# Usage Notes
- Start server by running `yarn start`. This launches razzle, which in turn manages two webpack processes, one for the server, one for the client.

# Notes on usage of repo
- Use `yarn`, not `npm`








# Get the razzle example running

Steps:

1. Download repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gregberge/loadable-components.git

```

3. install [https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install](yarn) if haven't already
4. install project dependencies

5. run locally or build and serve
